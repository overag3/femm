# FEMM

FEMM is a suite of programs for solving low frequency electromagnetic problems on two-dimensionalplanar and axisymmetric domains.  
The program currently addresses linear/nonlinear magneto-static problems, linear/nonlinear time harmonic magneticproblems, linear electrostatic problems,and steady-state heat flow problems.
